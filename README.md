# Kubejs Mekanism Polonium Alternate Recipe for Extreme Reactors / Big Reactors
 Conversion recipe path between Extreme Reactors Blutonium to Mekanism Polonium

## Description:
Mekanism Mekasuit requires Polonium to produce, which can only be made by from nucelar waste from a Mekanism fission reactor processed in a solar neutron activator. As I have gone down the Extreme Reactors/Big Reactors route instead I did not want to build a seperate reactor just for this 1 off build. Additionally I did not want to use the solar neutron activator because of its restrictions to being outside, its climate requirements and variable output due to solar exposure so I created an alternate recipe.

 ## Recipe Path:

 ### Step 1
Mekanism Chemical Oxidizer

1 BigReactors Blutonium Ingot = 1000mb of Mekanism Plutonium Gas

### Step 2
Mekanism Isotopic Centrifuge

1000mb of Mekanism Plutonium Gas = 100mb of Mekanism Polonium Gas
